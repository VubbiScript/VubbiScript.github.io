### Version 0.5.01 (26 nov 2019)

  * Fixed issue where combining "wait" block and custom memory variables was producing wrong code

### Version 0.5.0 (01 sep 2018)

  * Introducing English version! Vubbi is now available in both English and Dutch.
  * Introduction of buttons to toggle the visibility of memory fields. With these buttons you can hide internal variables in Unity.

  * Introduced "Read-only" mode to display the blocks in the documentation on the website.
  * Some smaller changes...

Uh! Oh! Older content of this page is not yet available in the English version of this site. I am working on it! 

You could check out the Dutch version instead by switching language in the menu.
