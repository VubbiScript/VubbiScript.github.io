Are you itching to make games in Unity3D but is programming too difficult?

## The Vubbi plugin for Unity3D

VubbiScript is a plugin for Unity3D which allows you to do visual programming in Unity3D. Going from Scratch to programming in C# can be a big step for children. VubbiScript makes this step a lot smaller!

## Ok, how do I start?

Go toÂ [Start with Vubbi!]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/en/getting-started.md %})


## Why Unity?

Well, that is easy!

Unity contains a lot of things which make it easy to make games. With the built-in physics you can make blocks fall or you can build towers. Physics also allow you to push objects, detect if objects hit each other or even configure how hard objects bounce.

In Unity you can easily make buttons, use animation, clone objects... and if you don't know how to draw 2D images or 3D objects you can always download some from the Asset Store.

Finally, if your game is ready, you can export it to your SmartPhone, Computer or even your website so that everyone can play your game!
