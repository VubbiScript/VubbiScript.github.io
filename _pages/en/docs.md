## Welcome in the documentation!

Vubbi is a block based code editor for Unity. The editor (with a script opened) looks like this:

{% capture imgurl %}{{site.baseurl}}{% link assets/img/vubbiscreen.png %}{% endcapture %}
{% include util/capimg.html url=imgurl caption="The Vubbi editor with a script \"KogelBots\" opened. To the left of the screen you see blocks in the \"logic\" category." %}

There are quite some cateogies with blocks. **In this documentation you will find all the available blocks with more information.**

![VubbiFileIcon.png]({{site.baseurl}}{% link assets/img/vubbifileicon.png %}){:.img-right}

Next to the blocks, you will also find some additional information about the other features of the plugin. There is also a page with information about the supported "datatypes" in Vubbi and some details on how to switch to C#.  
Finally there is a small overview of future blocks.
