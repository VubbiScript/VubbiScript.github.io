Hello there!

My name is Jeroen Penninck.
I studied software engineering at the University Ghent and my current job is programmer at [Esko](https://www.esko.com/en/).

Since 2015 I am also a coach at [CoderDojo](https://coderdojobelgium.be/en) Aalst. CoderDojo is an organisation where kids can learn to program.

For kids that want to make games after they get bored with Scratch, Unity3D seems like a good option. To switch to Unity3D from Scratch is quite a big step. To make the hurdle smaller I started writing Vubbi.
Unity is already really challenging without also having to learn to program C#.

More information about me can be found on [my website](http://jeroenp.awardspace.com/).

Do you want to ask me a question or help? <a class="contactmelink">Contact me</a>.
