### What is inside the example project?

  * **physics** = asteroids collide and stay inside the screen. Bullets collide with asteroids, ... + 100% bounciness makes sure everything keeps moving.
  * **cloning** = you can keep shooting bullets by pressing space!
  * **score** = every time you shoot an asteroid your score increases
  * **lives & game over** = the space ship gets broken more and more every time it collides with an asteroid...
  * **animation** = the explosion that is shown when the spaceship explodes uses Unity animation.
  * **prefabs** = an object can be created once an re-used all the time (like asteroids and bullets)
  * VubbiScript 0.5.01 is installed
