## First backup (optional)

Note: I try my best to make sure new version of Vubbi keep working with scripts that are created with older versions. It is however always possible that I make a mistake...

To make sure you don't lose work (because I made a mistake) you can - before you remove the folder - first make a backup of your complete project. You can do this by:

  1. Close Unity
  2. Copy the full directory containing your Unity project to another location
  3. Open your project again

## upgrade Vubbi

Upgrading Vubbi is easy, simply follow these steps:

  1. Make sure your project is saved (and that you have a backup if you don't want to lose your work if something goes wrong).
  2. From inside Unity delete the folder "VubbiScript" in "Editor Default Resources/Editor".
  3. Download a newer version of Vubbi and import it as usual.
  4. Restart Unity and re-open your project.
  5. If everything went fine you now have the new version of Vubbi.
